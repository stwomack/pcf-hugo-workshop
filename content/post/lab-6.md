### Goal
In this workshop, you will learn how to Build Pipelines to for unit testing, staging and production deployment to Cloud Foundry using Concourse.ci

<!--more-->

### Introduction

Concourse's end goal is to provide an expressive CI system with as few distinct moving parts as possible.

Concourse CI decouples your project from your CI's details, and keeping all configuration in declarative files that can be checked into version control.

<img src="/images/concourse-1.png" alt="Concourse CI" style="width: 100%;"/>

Concourse limits itself to three core concepts: tasks, resources, and the jobs that compose them. Interesting features like timed triggers and synchronizing usage of external environments are modeled in terms of these, rather than as layers on top.

With these primitives you can model any pipeline, from simple (unit → integration → deploy → ship) to complex (testing on multiple infrastructures, fanning out and in, etc.).

Prerequisites
--

1. Java SDK 1.7+

2. Pivotal CF Env or Pivotal Web Services Account.  Create a free trial account here [Pivotal Web Services](http://run.pivotal.io/)

3. Optional Vagrant (https://vagrantup.com/) to run Concourse locally

4. Optional VirtualBox (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

5. Fly cli. The fly tool is a command line interface to Concourse, it available when you bring up Concourse

6. AWS Account with S3 Bucket and Concourse in AWS




Steps
--
In this workshop we are going to follow these steps to use the Concourse.CI to build pipelines and trigger pipelines to continuously deploy code on Cloud Foundry.


Learn how to

    - Start and Configure Concourse.CI server
    - Create a Pipeline
    - Trigger a Pipeline using Fly
    - Run a pipeline to test, stage and deploy on Cloud Foundry


***

## Part 1: Configure Concourse.CI Server in AWS

### Step 1
##### Download Fly and Target Concourse CI Server in AWS

The Concourse Server in AWS is already configured from an existing AMI for this workshop.

   Open a browser window and launch ***https://52.54.77.21***

   The userid/password for this server is
   ```
      userid: pivotal
      password: <distributed in the workshop>
   ```

   Download the fly cli from the main web page based on your OS or from the bottom right corner

   <img src="/images/concourse-4.png" alt="Concourse FLY" style="width: 100%;"/>

  OR

   <img src="/images/concourse-9.png" alt="Concourse FLY" style="width: 100%;"/>

Open a cmd/terminal and target the concourse server.

We will call our Concourse CI Server as *```aws```*

    $ fly -t aws login -c https://52.54.77.21 -k

    Use the same userid / password combination.

### Step 2
##### Create your first pipeline

We have an existing project `flight-school` in a git repo, which we can clone and use for our first pipeline.

````
$ git clone https://github.com/rjain-pivotal/flight-school.git
$ cd flight-school

````

In the ci folder there is a properties file, flight-school-properties-sample.yml

This contains the cf and git specific configuration which is read by the pipeline. You don't want your configuration user name/passwords etc to be stored in the repository. Hence you will make a local copy of the file and add your specific configuration. This makes the CI pipeline portable across teams.

Make a local copy of the flight-school-properties-sample.yml


````
// These instructions are for Linux/OS. Please use the correct commands for Windows
mkdir ~/.concourse
cp ci/flight-school-properties-sample.yml ~/.concourse/flight-school-properties.yml
// This command is not required for Windows
chmod 600 ~/.concourse/flight-school-properties.yml
````

Now edit the ~/.concourse/flight-school-properties.yml
Be sure to point to the correct github-uri. The simplest uri to use is the same from the clone command in step 2.

````
github-uri: https://github.com/rjain-pivotal/flight-school.git
github-branch: master
cf-api: https://api.run.haas-100.-88.pez.pivotal.io
cf-username: <studentXXX>
cf-password: <password>
cf-org: <studentXXX>-org
cf-space: development
cf-manifest-host: <studentXXX>-flight-school-ci

````

Review your pipeline file in the ci folder\pipeline.yml

````
resources:
- name: flight-school
  type: git
  source:
      uri: {{github-uri}}
      branch: {{github-branch}}
- name: staging-app
  type: cf
  source:
      api: {{cf-api}}
      username: {{cf-username}}
      password: {{cf-password}}
      organization: {{cf-org}}
      space: {{cf-space}}
      skip_cert_check: true

jobs:
- name: test-app
  plan:
  - get: flight-school
    trigger: true
  - task: tests
    file: flight-school/ci/tasks/build.yml
  - put: staging-app
    params:
      manifest: flight-school/manifest.yml

````

This pipeline has two resources and a single job. The resource `flight-school` is the `git` repo and the resource `staging-app` is the `cloud-foundry` space to stage the app.

The single job in the pipeline `test-app` gets the source code from git on any commits to the repo, and triggers the task defined in the `build.yml`. Next, on completion of this task, it puts the output artifact in to the staging-app resource using the manifest file defined for `cf push`

Edit the manifest file to reflect your app name

````bash
cd ..
nano manifest.yml
````

````
name: <student-id>-flight-school
memory: 128M
random-route: true
path: .

````


### Step 3
##### Set the Pipeline using Fly


Now you have your pipeline defined, it is ready to be uploaded to the CI Server.

Name your pipeline based on your studentXXX id

````
$ fly -t aws set-pipeline -p studentXXX-flight-school -c ci/pipeline.yml -l ~/.concourse/flight-school-properties.yml
````


### Step 4
##### Trigger the Pipeline and stage the app

Test the tasks manually before you run the whole Pipelines
````
$ fly -t aws execute -c ci/tasks/build.yml
````


````
$ fly -t aws pipelines // This will list all the pipelines

$ fly -t aws unpause-pipeline -p studentXXX-flight-school  // this will unpause the pipeline. You can also press play in the web ui

$ fly -t aws trigger-job --job studentXXX-flight-school/test-app
````


<img src="/images/concourse-2.png" alt="Concourse CI" style="width: 100%;"/>


Open up a new browser window and launch you just pushed app. You can get the URL of the app using

````
cf apps
````

<img src="/images/concourse-5.png" alt="Concourse FLY" style="width: 100%;"/>



### Step 5
##### Drill into the Concourse UI

Select the pipeline from the Web UI and double click on the test-app stage. This will bring up the up the details of the step.


<img src="/images/concourse-6.png" alt="Concourse FLY" style="width: 100%;"/>

To delete the pipeline, run the following command:

````
$ fly -t aws destroy-pipeline -p studentXXX-flight-school // This will DELETE the pipeline from Concourse
````

## Part 2: Running a real world pipeline

### Step 6
##### Configure a multi step pipeline

1. Clone the git repo which has a sample app PCFDemo with a real world pipeline.

    ````
    https://github.com/rjain-pivotal/PCF-demo
    ````

2. Change the manifest.yml to in the PCF-demo directory to reflect your studentID

    ````
    applications:
      name: studentXXX-pcfdemo
      memory: 512M
      instances: 1
      host: studentXXX-pcfdemo
      path: ./target/pcfdemo.war
    ````
3. We have S3 buckets configured to save your artifacts and the IAM user credentials to access the bucket. This will be given during the workshop.
4. Configure the properties files and assign it to the pipeline

    Copy the pcfdemo-properties-sample.yml to your ~/.concourse/pcfdemo-properties.yml
    Change the cf properties, github properties and s3 properties.

    ````
    github-uri: https://github.com/<github-user>/PCF-demo.git
    github-branch: master
    s3-access-key-id: SAMPLEDF99FSWEBF9DW9  # AWS or S3 compatible access key id
    s3-secret-access-key: sampleaxfdpiA98FG8u7ahd08Sdgf8AFG8gh8S0F  # AWS or S3 compatible secret access key
    s3-endpoint: s3.amazonaws.com
    s3-bucket-version: studentXXX-pcfdemo-releases
    s3-bucket-releases: studentXXX-pcfdemo-releases
    s3-bucket-release-candidates: studentXXX-pcfdemo-release-candidates
    maven-opts: # -Xms256m -Xmx512m
    maven-config: # -s path/to/settings.xml
    cf-api: https://api.run.haas-100.68.pez.pivotal.io
    cf-username: studentXXX
    cf-password: studentXXX-password
    cf-org: studentXXX-org
    cf-space: development
    cf-manifest-host: studentXXX-pcfdemo-ci
    ````



5. Set the pipeline


    ````
    fly -t aws set-pipeline -p studentXXX-pcfdemo -c ci/pipeline.yml -l ~/.concourse/pcfdemo-properties.yml
    ````

6. List all the pipelines

    ````
    fly -t aws pipelines
    //targeting https://52.54.77.21
    name                     paused
    student20-flight-school  yes   
    student25-pcfdemo        yes   
    ````

7. Trigger the pipeline using the Web UI

    Click on the "Burger" button on the top left corner. This will bring up the Pipelines. Click on you pipeline and press play.

    <img src="/images/concourse-7.png" alt="Concourse CI" style="width: 100%;"/>


    This will trigger your pipeline. Click on the Unit Test step to see the details.

    <img src="/images/concourse-8.png" alt="Concourse CI" style="width: 100%;"/>



8. Call the Ship-it step, Replace the name of the pipeline with your pipeline name

    ````
    fly -t aws trigger-job -j studentXXX-pcfdemo/ship-it
    ````

    Once the complete Pipeline finishes you should be able to see all the steps in green.

    <img src="/images/concourse-3.png" alt="Concourse CI" style="width: 100%;"/>


9. Open the app in browser

    ````
    cf apps // Get the App Names and URL
    ````

    Open a browser and check the app load. (https://studentXXX-pcfdemo-ci.run.haas-100.pez.pivotal.io)

## Part 3: Optional Installing Concourse Locally

### Step 7
##### Configure your Concourse.CI server

If you have a Mac, you can download the Concourse CI server and boot up using vagrant. This step will take some time, you can do this prior to the start of the workshop presentation.

````bash
$ mkdir ciworkshop
& cd ciworkshop
$ vagrant init concourse/lite # creates ./Vagrantfile
$ vagrant up                  # downloads the box and spins up the VM
````
The web server will be running at http://192.168.100.4:8080

Open up the Concourse UI web page, you don't have any pipelines configured. But you can download the fly cli from here. At the right hand bottom, use the links to download the **fly cli**.

If you're on Linux or OS X, you will have to `chmod +x` the downloaded binary and put it in your $PATH

Next, lets target and login to the Concourse server

Locally use this
````bash
$ fly -t lite login -c http://192.168.100.4:8080
````

You can repeat **Part 1** and **Part 2**, but make sure you change the target from `aws` to `lite` in the fly cli commands
