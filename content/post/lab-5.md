### Goal
In this workshop, you will learn how to apply the circuit breaker pattern in your Spring boot apps.

<!--more-->

### Introduction

Spring Cloud provides tools for developers to quickly build some of the common patterns in distributed systems (e.g. configuration management, service discovery, circuit breakers, intelligent routing, micro-proxy, control bus, one-time tokens, global locks, leadership election, distributed sessions, cluster state). Coordination of distributed systems leads to boiler plate patterns, and using Spring Cloud developers can quickly stand up services and applications that implement those patterns. They will work well in any distributed environment, including the developer’s own laptop, bare metal data centers, and managed platforms such as Cloud Foundry.

The big picture : Use Spring Cloud Services design patterns to build cloud Native applications

<img src="/images/spring-1.png" alt="Cloud Native Spring Application Architecture" style="width: 600px;"/>


Circuit Breaker Dashboard for Pivotal Cloud Foundry® (PCF) provides Spring applications with an implementation of the Circuit Breaker pattern. Cloud-native architectures are typically composed of multiple layers of distributed services. End-user requests may comprise multiple calls to these services, and if a lower-level service fails, the failure can cascade up to the end user and spread to other dependent services. Heavy traffic to a failing service can also make it difficult to repair. Using Circuit Breaker Dashboard, you can prevent failures from cascading and provide fallback behavior until a failing service is restored to normal operation.

Steps
--
In this workshop we are going to follow these steps to use the circuit-breaker in a Cloud Native Spring Boot app on Cloud foundry using the Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker Service.


Learn how to


    - Config a Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker Service
    - Use Circuit Breaker  (Hysterix) in a Spring Boot application
    - Simulate a failure and watch the circuit breaker manage failures
    - Restore the service and watch the circuit breaker restore back the circuit


When applied to a service, a circuit breaker watches for failing calls to the service. If failures reach a certain threshold, it “opens” the circuit and automatically redirects calls to the specified fallback mechanism. This gives the failing service time to recover.

Desired the architecture of this Cloud Native Spring boot app is:

### Step 1
##### Get the traveler app

Clone the git repo which has a simple boilerplate Spring boot app built using Spring Initializer.

The Spring Labs repo contains multiple apps, we are going to focus on traveler app in this exercise.

````
git clone https://github.com/rjain-pivotal/pcf-workshop-spring-labs.git
````

More info on Spring Initializer (http://start.spring.io/)

### Step 2
##### Login into Pivotal Cloud Foundry

The students have userId's (student1-student25) and the passwords will be distributed in the workshop.
Each student is assigned their own Organization (student1-org)

````
cf login -a https://api.pcf2.cloud.fe.pivotal.io --skip-ssl-validation
  Email: student1
  Password: ••••••••
````

Login to the App Console at https://apps.pcf2.cloud.fe.pivotal.io

  <img src="/images/pcf-console.png" alt="PCF App Console" style="width: 600px;"/>



### Step 3
##### Configure the Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker Instance from the marketplace

1. In the PCF App Console, create a instance of the Registry Service from the marketplace.

      <img src="/images/pcf-console-2.png" alt="Marketplace Services" style="width: 600px;"/>

2. Select the default plan.
3. Name the service instance as 'studentXX-circuit-breaker-dashboard'

      <img src="/images/circuit-breaker-2.png" alt="Circuit Breaker" style="width: 600px;"/>

4. This will create the studentXX-circuit-breaker-dashboard service instance. To view the configuration of this service by clicking manage.

### Step 4

##### Code walk through (traveler)

Let's walk through the code in the traveler app in the source repo (Step #1) using your favorite editor (Atom/Sublime/Eclipse/IntelliJ/STS)

1. Review the *traveler/agency/src/main/java/agency/AgencyApplication.java* file.

      To work with a Circuit Breaker Dashboard instance, your application must include the `@EnableCircuitBreaker` annotation on a configuration class.

      ````
      import org.springframework.cloud.client.discovery.EnableDiscoveryClient;

      @SpringBootApplication
      @EnableDiscoveryClient
      @RestController
      @EnableCircuitBreaker
      public class AgencyApplication {

      ````

2. Review the *traveler/pom.xml* file. By adding *spring-cloud-services-starter-service-registry* to the classpath this application is eligible to register and discover services with the service-registry.

      ````
      <dependency>
      	<groupId>io.pivotal.spring.cloud</groupId>
      	<artifactId>spring-cloud-services-starter-service-registry</artifactId>
      </dependency>
      ````

3. Review the *traveler/src/main/java/io/pivotal/FortuneServiceApplication.java*

      Notice the ````@EnableDiscoveryClient.```` This enables a discovery client that registers the traveler with the service-registry application.

        @SpringBootApplication
        @EnableDiscoveryClient
        public class FortuneServiceApplication {

            public static void main(String[] args) {
                SpringApplication.run(FortuneServiceApplication.class, args);
            }
        }



### Step 5
##### Push the app to cloud Foundry

1. Change the manifest.yml file in the traveler/ to reflect the name of the app and the service-registry

        ---
        applications:
        - name: <studentXXX>-traveler
          memory: 512MB
          instances: 1
          host: traveler-${random-word}
          path: ./target/traveler-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
          services:
          - rj-service-registry
          env:
            CF_TARGET: https://api.pcf2.cloud.fe.pivotal.io



2. Build the app using maven

      ````
      mvn clean package
      ````

3. Push the app using cf cli

      ````
      cf push
      ````

6. Open in the browser the App
   Get the route to your app

      ````
      http://traveler-decompressive-retrenchment.pcf2.cloud.fe.pivotal.io/
      ````

### Step 6
##### Verify the App is registered in the Service Registry

After the a few moments, check the service-registry dashboard. Confirm the traveler is registered.

***
## PART 2: Consume a service.

### Step 7
##### Build Restful interface for consuming services using Netflix Feign

You have the greeting-service app in the cloned repo (Step 1) which has the client to consume service.

Lets walk through the code

1. In the greeting-service/pom.xml file , with the *spring-cloud-starter-feign*  dependency,  this application is eligible to discover services with the service-registry.
      ````
      <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-feign</artifactId>
      </dependency>
      ````

2. In the *GreetingFeignApplication.java* includes the @EnableDiscoveryClient annotation on a configuration class. To have Feign client interfaces automatically configured, it must also use the @EnableFeignClients annotation.

      ````
      @SpringBootApplication
      @EnableDiscoveryClient
      @EnableFeignClients
      public class GreetingFeignApplication {

          public static void main(String[] args) {
              SpringApplication.run(GreetingFeignApplication.class, args);
          }

      }
      ````


3. To call a registered service, a consuming application can use a URI with a hostname matching the name with which the service is registered in the Service Registry. This way, the consuming application does not need to know the service application’s actual URL; the Registry will take care of finding and routing to the service.

      Pivotal Cloud Foundry installation is configured to only allow HTTPS traffic, you must specify the https:// scheme in the base URI used by your client application.

      ````
      @FeignClient("https://traveler")
      public interface FortuneServiceClient {

      	 @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET, value = "/")
      	 String getFortune();
      }
      ````


### Step 8
##### Build and Push the Consuming app

1. Next, update the manifest.yml

        ---
        applications:
        - name: greeting-feign
          memory: 512MB
          instances: 1
          host: greeting-feign-${random-word}
          path: ./target/greeting-feign-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
          services:
          - rj-service-registry
          env:
            CF_TARGET: https://api.pcf2.cloud.fe.pivotal.io




2. Build the app using maven

      ````
      mvn clean package
      ````

3. Push the app using cf cli

      ````
      cf push
      ````

6. Open in the browser the App
   Get the route to your app

      ````
      http://greeting-feign-noncompetitive-dairy.pcf2.cloud.fe.pivotal.io/
      ````

      <img src="/images/pcf-registry-example.png" alt="Service Registry Example" style="width: 600px;"/>

### Step 9
##### Verify the App is registered in the Service Registry

This app is also registered as a service in the Service registry. Check the service-registry dashboard. Confirm the traveler and greeting-feign is registered.
